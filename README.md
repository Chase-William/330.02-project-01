## Getting Started

Inside the `vendor` directory you can find the *mysql-connector-java-8.0.21.jar* which will need to be set as a dependency.

I also tossed in the *project.sql* for creating the database and all the tables requires for this project. Simply just `SOURCE` it and provide the correct path to get that setup.
