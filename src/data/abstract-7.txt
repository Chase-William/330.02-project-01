This book will help the reader take the step from competent C++ developer to designer or architect. It includes some C++ 17.  Intended to be a master class in C++ design in a book, Practical C++ Design guides the reader through the design and C++ implementation of a fun and engaging case study. The journey begins with a quick exploration of the requirements for building the case study, a multi-platform Reverse Polish Notation calculator. Next, the reader delves into selecting an appropriate architecture, eventually designing and implementing all of the necessary modules to meet the calculator’s requirements. By the conclusion of the book, the reader will have constructed a fully functioning calculator that builds and executes on multiple platforms. The book includes access to the author’s complete implementation, which is available for download from GitHub.
