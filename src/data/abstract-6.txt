Java Program Design presents program design principles to help practicing programmers up their game and remain relevant in the face of changing trends and an evolving language. The book enhances the traditional design patterns with Java's new functional programming features, such as functional interfaces and lambda expressions. The result is a fresh treatment of design patterns that expands their power and applicability, and reflects current best practice.
